              Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science of making machines capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence. AI allows computers to learn from experience, adapt to new information, and execute tasks with human-like reasoning. <br><br><br>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on building algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. In other words, ML allows machines to improve their performance over time by recognizing patterns and relationships in data. It has numerous real-world applications, from virtual assistants like Siri to recommendation systems like those used by Netflix and Amazon. AI and ML are revolutionizing industries such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles, ushering in a new era of technology-driven innovation that promises to shape our future in exciting and transformative ways.<br><br>

It helps them make smart decisions without being explicitly programmed for every situation. Machine Learning, a subset of AI, allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time.<br> These technologies power voice assistants, personalized recommendations, and many other cool applications that make our lives easier and more enjoyable.It is future world .<br>Here's a simpler real-time example of AI and Machine Learning:<br><br>Imagine using a language learning app on your phone. The app is super smart because of AI and Machine Learning.<br><br>

<b>Personal Help:</b> The app learns how you learn best and what you find hard or easy.<br>

<b>Custom Lessons:</b> It gives you lessons made just for you, focusing on what you need most.<br>

<b>Hear and Correct:</b> When you speak, the app listens and tells you how to improve your pronunciation.<br>

<b>Smart Tips:</b> It suggests lessons and exercises based on what you want to achieve.<br>

<b>Instant Translator:</b> You can point your camera at foreign text, and the app translates it right away.<br><br>

The app gets smarter as you use it, making your language learning experience super effective!
