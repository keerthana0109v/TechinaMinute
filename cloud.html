              Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computing resources (such as servers, storage, databases, software, and networking) over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical infrastructure, users can rent these resources from cloud service providers. The term "cloud" refers to the internet, and the computing services are delivered remotely through data centers managed by the providers. This model offers numerous benefits, including scalability, flexibility, cost-efficiency, and ease of use. Users can scale resources up or down as needed, pay only for what they use, and access their applications and data from anywhere with an internet connection. Cloud computing has become a fundamental part of modern technology, powering a wide range of services and applications that impact both individual users and businesses across the globe.<br><br>

You can access your stuff from anywhere with an internet connection, and you only pay for what you actually use. It's like having a virtual, on-demand computer that you can tap into whenever you need it.<br><br>
        	Let's say you take a lot of photos with your smartphone, and your device's storage is almost full. Instead of deleting your precious memories, you decide to use a cloud storage service, like Google Drive or iCloud.<br>You sign up for the service, install the app on your phone, and "upload" your photos to the cloud. Now, your photos are safely stored on remote servers maintained by the cloud provider.Whenever you want to view or share these photos, you can access them from your phone, tablet, or computer, as long as you have an internet connection. Even if you lose or replace your phone, your photos will still be safe in the cloud.
