              IoT stands for the Internet of Things. It refers to a network of physical objects or "things" that are embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity, allowing them to collect and exchange data over the internet. <br>These objects can be everyday devices such as smart appliances, wearables, home automation systems, industrial machines, or even vehicles.<br> The data collected by these devices can be analyzed and used to make intelligent decisions, automate processes, and create new services or applications. IoT has the potential to revolutionize various industries, improving efficiency, convenience, and safety in our daily lives and transforming how businesses operate.<br><br>
              Blockchain can provide a secure and trustworthy way for IoT devices to communicate and share data, ensuring data integrity and enabling automated processes without the need for central authorities.

These objects, like smart devices and sensors, can collect and share data with each other and with us. It makes things smarter and allows us to control and monitor them remotely, bringing more convenience and efficiency to our lives.<br> For example, you can turn on your home's lights or adjust the thermostat using your smartphone, even when you're not at home. IoT is all about making our world more interconnected and intelligent.<br><br>Let's use a real-time example of IoT (Internet of Things) in simpler terms:<br><br>Imagine you have a "Smart Home" equipped with IoT devices.<br>
        	<b>Smart Thermostat:</b> You have a smart thermostat connected to the internet. It knows when you're home or away and can adjust the temperature accordingly to save energy.<br>

<b>Smart Lights:</b> Your lights are also smart. You can control them from your phone, even if you're not at home. You can turn them on or off, or even change their color.<br>

<b>Smart Fridge:</b> Your fridge is connected to the internet too. It can keep track of the food inside and even suggest recipes based on what you have.<br>

<b>Smart Security Cameras:</b> You have security cameras outside your home that stream live video to your phone. You can check in on your house whenever you want, even when you're on vacation.<br>

<b>Smart Voice Assistant:</b> You have a smart speaker with a voice assistant like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. You can ask it questions, control your other smart devices, and even play music with just your voice.
